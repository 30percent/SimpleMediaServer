# SimpleMediaServer
Simple web based home media server

### Description

MeTube is a functional imitation of media sharing sites (Youtube, Dailymotion, etc.). While significantly stripped down in presentation and lacks a few of the features, it provides a good example of a system based around user created content. The design of the project gives a fair overview of a common use­case for the LAMP software bundle (Linux OS, Apache http, MySQL, PHP). This involves: A mySQL database backend that holds all long­term information. PHP scripts to provide the web server access to the database and distribute parsable information to Apache. And HTTP sources using a number of tools to the give the user an experience they can participate in.
